A friend had heard about his performance from a grade school grandchild who was impressed with his message and performance. The children, whom he selected to interact on stage were delighted to be chosen. His Q & A after was engaging and encouraged those free thinking artisans in the audience to continue to see this gift as valuable, as he relayed his interest in people watching and mimicing voices/body language as a child, which led to his performance career.

I suggest a study be conducted of the number of Gender population attending the events.  Do you have more women or men attending events. Then have your capital improvements to meet those attendance demands for bathroom usage.
I suggest that the Men's bathroom be remodeled given the small square footage.
I suggest the installation of a bath tub urinal to increase usage and still maintain the square footage. Like Baseball stadiums.
The Lobby area was crowded during the intermission. 
THE LOBBY BAR
The Bar area created unusual lines in the crowd to meet the attendees thirst and should be accommodating, relocated and redesigned. 
IMMEDIATE SOLUTION
I suggest a water/soda vending machine be installed reducing the Bar visitation to just Alcohol. 
When buying a ticket, add the cost of two/ water sodas GESA tokens. The GESA token to be handed out at the entry checkpoint. . The GESA tokens would be reused when the machine collection occurs. Cost would be minimal, usage would increase and Bar area crowd reduced.",,,,,,

No plot development, no character/relationship development, repetitive flat dialogue, repetitive photography. It was a first-time movie-makers effort and should have been advertised as such. Mis advertising an event doesn’t serve the powerhouse well— people decide they can’t trust the programming and won’t return. I recently heard from a couple who went to the holiday “family” shorts last year, which turned into an extreme horror/violent movie event and they said they haven’t been back since. I hope you find this helpful. It is how I intended it to be. I want powerhouse to succeed. ","Advertise accurately what an event actually is.  Do you have a local group/ person (marketing person) pre-screening before accepting an item in your programm8mg? That might be safer. This is not censorship. It should be quality control that ensures a certain standard of events at Gesa. And they can be edgy and even risqué, but high quality. ",,,,,,

The event was promoted on social media as DINNER with food provided from multiple local purveyors. Instead Marcus Whitman was the only provider of eats and they were finger food appetizers. We saved our appetites for this event and were very hungry by the time the event ended. The appetizers were good but not great. For the price we paid, I would have expected two comp glasses of wine per attendee, especially given the smallish size of the pours.

The film sound was muffled in the balcony for us. Also given the accents of the people featured in the films, having captions displayed would have been very helpful. Also good for people with less than perfect hearing. The films felt longer than they needed to be and the subject matter could have more varied. The non-documentary film was entertaining. 
The event didn't deliver the value relative to the cost of the tickets. Highly unlikely we will attend the Film Feast if it returns next year.

Both sound quality and projection quality were good.  Movies like this are of high value to the community in that they are unlikely to appear in for profit cinemas that need to screen a show multiple times.  ","I would like to see more movies at Gesa.  It’s a good venue for “arty” or even foreign films.  However, those films require a first class marketing program which I don’t think Gesa has yet managed to accomplish.  Looking at the list of where we might hear of these films, there doesn’t seem to be any outlet targeting college students at Whitman or Whitman’s arts/drama/music departments.  There are documentaries  (such as “giants Rising”) that would be of interest to younger people if the marketing informs them effectively and in advance.  At the screening, there were movies previewed that I was unaware of (not in the Gesa brochure that was handed out).  There has been Quest classes on movies but I don’t think those potential audiences have been targeted.  
I would also be interested in seeing Gesa explore subscribing to NTLive programming.  That might be a partnership with the colleges/university offering a student discount price.  Please look into NTLive (National Theater of London productions that are filmed on the final night of performances that are at times better than the actual show — I saw a live performance and later the NTLive film of the live production: the camera angles gave much better reading of the actors than seeing it live.).

It was dark, profane, disturbing and utterly unsuitable. One clip could only be called a horror short, I don’t care that they tried to be humorous with spurting green blood instead of red.

If there is one thing that could take the Powerhouse from good to great, it would be to allow seating of patrons one hour before show time. After a certain age, adults do not enjoy being mashed together like a techno club mosh pit or a cattle truck.  If lighting and sound checks need to be done before the show, I would humbly suggest that the technicians come in a half hour earlier.  If the performer gets too claustrophobic waiting an hour before the show, then we might consider updating the Green Room.
I have observed patrons becoming angry,  waiting  half an hour for the  doors to open. lve also observed the opposite.  The inevitable outcome of opening the house only 30 min before show time, is that you've trained patrons to arrive at the last minute and then they are being seated after the show  has begun.  This is incredibly distracting for the audience and  perhaps for the performer as  well.

I realize that there may be very little that can be done about this, but my main comment for things to improve would be the congestion of the lobby before the show. I realize there are several things that need to take place (will call, ticket scanning, coat check, bar, etc.) in a relatively small space, but the crowding means people have to wait outside for a while so that they can squeeze between people to get through the lobby.

As a viewer I was taken out of the experience more than two times due to the house lights being on. Reference the russia tour of Billy Joel when he explains how much of an AV fail that is. When the house lights go down...keep em down. If the artist requests to have the audience a bit visible for the use of a practical part of the show that is planned, suggest other lighting sources from the stage such as the warmer lights used half way between the first act, to reflect on the audience. This venue is small enough to not have to worry about a disconnect from the performer to the audince, so I will stand by the fact that the house lights should stay down unless it is an emergency or intermission...or over lol.","I would say that I would have loved for the security guard to have come down near the isle to reprimand the clown who had his flash on multiple times for pictures, instead of him being so near the stage and talking down to the front row. It was almost equally as distracting as the flashing light from the clown audience member. so if something like that happens to try to be stealthy before being tough. ninja not barbarian ;)",NordicFiddlersBloc,No,,,,

Good production quality, except for one card trick for which the lighting was dimmed and I couldn’t see a thing he was doing. Thought the tickets were a bit overpriced; $40 seems more reasonable. 
Just as a side note, when I originally saw the photo of him that is included in the brochure and read the description of him as a daring escape artist, I was not interested. I thought the show would be focused on escapes, which I really don’t enjoy (also, I thought the photo gave kind of a dark impression of both him and the show—not appealing to me). I bought the tickets later not realizing this was the same show I’d read about earlier, and regretted it. But we went anyway, so as not to waste the money spent, and happily it was more focused on other kinds of magic than on escapes, so we enjoyed it.

Quality films like this will entice me to return for more.  Sound was clear.  Lighting was good. Was delighted to see Warren Etheredge made the trip over from Seattle to be at the screening in person.  That certainly indicates how important this film is.  Thanks to him!,"Wasn't sure what to expect based on the title.  The pre-film video clip gave me some helpful insight that it might not be entirely depressing.  Was initially thinking it may focus on suicide; then again, it could just be a coming of ""old"" age story and facing death.  The unravelling of the story kept me intrigued, and the primary relationship was brutally honest.  Found it quirky and sincere.  People seemed familiar with Daisy Ridley.  Haven't seen all the Star Wars films that brought her fame.  Glad local actor, Rich Hintz, was featured.",SometimesIThinkAboutDying,,,,No,No
