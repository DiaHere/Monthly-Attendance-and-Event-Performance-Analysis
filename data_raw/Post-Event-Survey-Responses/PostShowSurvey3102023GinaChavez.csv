The one  main light that shines on the audience from the lighting above the stage was too intense it kind of made me want to put on my sunglasses but that is all . Just maybe turn down that bright light that shines on the audience. Gina was so much fun!!!👌❤️,

Despite that, I think some of the instruments that were captured on mic slightly overpowered her vocal delivery.  Great enthusiasm from both performers and audience made for a warm and delightful experience.  Hope they continue to return to the Gesa for future performances.  Thanks!",

Their show was high-energy, positive, and engaging. The theatre is always a great place to catch live music, with good lighting, sound, sight lines, and intimacy with the performers. Your staff always do an excellent job.",I would appreciate having a divider panel installed between the two urinals in the men's restroom. Not everyone likes to pee with friends. Having a drinking fountain available would also be greatly appreciated.
