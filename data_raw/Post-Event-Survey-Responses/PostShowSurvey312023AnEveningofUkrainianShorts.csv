I was just sorry to see that more people didn't come.","Two things that disrupted my enjoyment/focus were a couple in front of me and a couple a few rows back of me, talking so much, laughing at things that weren't funny (I thought maybe they are drunk/high).  And 3 rows ahead of me, a woman continued to make noise with some wrapper of something she was eating. I don't know how we should deal with people like this."

Thought it was going to be more documentary-flavored.  Nonetheless, was a good experience.  Too bad more people didn't show up.  It's important to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for democracy and rebuilding war-torn homes.  Perhaps Walla Walla needs to be better educated on this topic.",

I am especially grateful that proceeds from snacks are being directed toward rebuilding Ukraine. Kudos to Warren for curating the films and to Gesa for showing them.,
