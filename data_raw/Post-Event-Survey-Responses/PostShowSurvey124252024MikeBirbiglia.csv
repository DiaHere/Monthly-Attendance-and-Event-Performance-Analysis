If there is one thing that could take the Powerhouse from good to great, it would be to allow seating of patrons one hour before show time. After a certain age, adults do not enjoy being mashed together like a techno club mosh pit or a cattle truck.  If lighting and sound checks need to be done before the show, I would humbly suggest that the technicians come in a half hour earlier.  If the performer gets too claustrophobic waiting an hour before the show, then we might consider updating the Green Room.
I have observed patrons becoming angry,  waiting  half an hour for the  doors to open. lve also observed the opposite.  The inevitable outcome of opening the house only 30 min before show time, is that you've trained patrons to arrive at the last minute and then they are being seated after the show  has begun.  This is incredibly distracting for the audience and  perhaps for the performer as  well.

A little tight standing room while waiting for the show to start, but once started it was fantastic! The staff is very friendly and accommodating, thank you!","If possible to make the waiting area larger before the show starts or allow patrons to go to their seats earlier, that would be a welcome addition!"

The staff was very friendly and communicative. We drove over 4 hours to see the show (from Boise) and we were very happy with the event. ","The temperature control in the venue could have been a bit better (it got quite stuffy in there). Additionally, better signage regarding where to wait would have been helpful. We were there for the 9pm show on Wednesday and the show before ran later than anticipated. Once we were allowed in, it was a bit confusing on where to go. We were not purchasing refreshments/waiting in line and there was not a lot of direction as to where to hang out while the theater was reset or where the theater entrance even was. "

And, it was a quick walk from the Marcus Whitman, where we were staying.",Great customer service is all about expectations being met or exceeded. We really appreciated your staff coming out and letting us know that the first show had run long and we had time to run to a convenience store to get cough drops and coffee.
