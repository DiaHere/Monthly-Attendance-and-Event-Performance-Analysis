The sound was excellent, even the quieter voices could easily be heard in the back.  The program was quite long, maybe one less speaker in the first half and one less in the second?  Or two less overall with no intermission?","It is a great place, and we are lucky to have it in town.  Thank you!"

The event itself was so powerful - the speakers, the stories, the writing, the vulnerability.  I felt really privileged to be told the stories.",Thank you for a wonderful event.
