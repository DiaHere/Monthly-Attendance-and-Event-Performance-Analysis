The lights were blinding the audience when full on. I was glad I brought my black fan, which I covered half my face with, peering from under it with one eye through much of the concert. Very, very disappointing. Especially paying $30, to be blinded through entire songs. Also, the vocals were hard to understand, a little muddy, not crisp. I heard that from another patron as well. And the people around me commented how rude it was to blind the audience. I love GPHT and want to be supportive, but I probably won't purchase the expensive front seat tickets again.","Just the lighting and sound, to make viewing less painful, and to hear diction in songs. For a lot of the concert, I couldn't hear her harmony where I was sitting. A friend in row G said he could."

The sound system seemed to require some help but after initial problems (couldn't hear the violinist initially, voice or instrument) but was still a bit 'garbled' - hard to distinguish any words.

Lighting was fine. Quality of performers was excellent. Sound was definitely off which made for an experience I would not repeat. I don't know who was responsible for the overpowering bass, but it needs to be corrected.",I think the acoustics could be improved if some sound baffles are installed to eliminate the tin sound while in the balcony seats.

I have seen them twice before in Leavenworth and I have all of their albums.  The talent of the band is unbelievable.  However, I was very disappointed with the sound system. For one thing, it was just way too loud for the size of the venue.  I was in the sixth row and my friends and I felt like we were being blasted with sound.  Even more frustrating was that the mix for the vocals seemed way off. We could hardly hear what Tom was singing. It sounded like he was under 10 feet of water. It probably sounded ok in the balcony but it was very muddy in the front rows.  The sad thing is that the acoustics are very good in the theatre.  I sing with the Choral Society and we have sung there several times. There is no need to blast the music like they are in a stadium.  Anyway, we still enjoyed the show, but were disappointed with the sound system. Please bring them back and turn down the amps! :) Thanks!",

The group's ability to change music styles was amazing.,"During the performance you allowed a group of at least 8 women to enter the theatre.  They disrupted the entire song and then kept moving and disrupting through the entire next song.  We were in aisle ""I"" and they were 2 aisles lower.  You can't let latecomers interrupt a performance!"
