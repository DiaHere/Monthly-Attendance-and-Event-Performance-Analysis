I would really like to see the Gesa PHT bring The Gothard Sisters here.  They are a Celtic group comprised of three beautiful and very talented musicians.  I have attached a link to their YouTube video performance of ""Hummingbird"" - a song that they wrote.  They are based in Edmonds, Washington (in the Seattle area).  They are very well known in the USA."

The sound was great quality and I enjoyed the event a lot.

As a viewer I was taken out of the experience more than two times due to the house lights being on. Reference the russia tour of Billy Joel when he explains how much of an AV fail that is. When the house lights go down...keep em down. If the artist requests to have the audience a bit visible for the use of a practical part of the show that is planned, suggest other lighting sources from the stage such as the warmer lights used half way between the first act, to reflect on the audience. This venue is small enough to not have to worry about a disconnect from the performer to the audince, so I will stand by the fact that the house lights should stay down unless it is an emergency or intermission...or over lol.","I would say that I would have loved for the security guard to have come down near the isle to reprimand the clown who had his flash on multiple times for pictures, instead of him being so near the stage and talking down to the front row. It was almost equally as distracting as the flashing light from the clown audience member. so if something like that happens to try to be stealthy before being tough. ninja not barbarian ;)"
