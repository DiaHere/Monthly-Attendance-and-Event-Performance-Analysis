Friendly staff, easy ticket process, comfortable seats, good acoustics, temperature just right, emailed info was really helpful in setting expectations and helping us plan. Knowing ahead of time it was 90 minutes without intermission made it possible to take care of bathroom needs without interruptions.","Holy Frit was so well done. I wish it could have been offered more than just one time. My partner was unavailable tonight. He would have loved this! 
   I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t want sugary beverages. I wish it would have been possible to bring water with me (since food and beverages were allowed in the theater.) I have kidney issues and am supposed to stay well hydrated. If bottled water was sold in the lobby, I missed it. 
    Gesa is such a great organization with wonderful volunteers. 
    We appreciate what you offer the community. 
   Keep up the good work."

Space needs absorption for sound; lots of hard surfaces …..
Maybe consider hospitality after the show for additional fundraising….

Both sound quality and projection quality were good.  Movies like this are of high value to the community in that they are unlikely to appear in for profit cinemas that need to screen a show multiple times.  ","I would like to see more movies at Gesa.  It’s a good venue for “arty” or even foreign films.  However, those films require a first class marketing program which I don’t think Gesa has yet managed to accomplish.  Looking at the list of where we might hear of these films, there doesn’t seem to be any outlet targeting college students at Whitman or Whitman’s arts/drama/music departments.  There are documentaries  (such as “giants Rising”) that would be of interest to younger people if the marketing informs them effectively and in advance.  At the screening, there were movies previewed that I was unaware of (not in the Gesa brochure that was handed out).  There has been Quest classes on movies but I don’t think those potential audiences have been targeted.  
I would also be interested in seeing Gesa explore subscribing to NTLive programming.  That might be a partnership with the colleges/university offering a student discount price.  Please look into NTLive (National Theater of London productions that are filmed on the final night of performances that are at times better than the actual show — I saw a live performance and later the NTLive film of the live production: the camera angles gave much better reading of the actors than seeing it live.). I highly recommend nearly all of their productions.  "

It encompassed captivating images; sound was just right; value was increased by the education which I feel I received watching the process of how to create stained/fused glass.  Such a journey for the artist, the production crews--glass makers, installers and camera manipulators, plus the courage it took to take on such an enormous endeavor.  The gigantic risks taken and the expenses incurred--constantly having to evolve was a great lesson for us all.","This was one of the most memorable films I've seen at the Powerhouse.  Full of fun, humor, challenge, beauty, collaboration, glass artistry and more--with the ultimate result.  This film hooked me on researching the largest commissioned stained-glass project in the world (at the time) because it made me want to know more.  What an incredible feat to have considered, accepted and produced.  When I saw the eyes of Jesus (I'm not particularly religious.), it touched me in a deeply spiritual way from an artistic perspective."
