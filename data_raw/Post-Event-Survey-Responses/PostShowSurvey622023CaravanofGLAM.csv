I loved everything about it and I would love to experience more performances like the Caravan of Glam in Walla Walla. It was great to be able to have such wonderful performers here.,"My only note is that it was fairly loud, possibly offering complimentary earplugs (or even ones for sale for $1) could be really helpful, especially for kids and neurodivergent folx. I brought my own earplugs, and I had a great time."

The performance was so high energy and fabulous. The dance party was a great idea. Thank you having security and also keeping chalk guy at bay. They’re so much to worry about these days and this wa an island in the storm. Thank you!,"I recently read that Europe has been giving “arts passes” to young people after the pandemic. They can use the money to go to live performances, museums, etc. I had a thought … it would be really nice to find a way to bring both young people and adults who typically can’t afford live performances into the Power House. One way would be applying for AAUW and other grants. Then finding ways to find the communities that need to come. Clearly, you have done excellent work getting the Triple Point youth in. Would be cool to let more Latino/a people in. Just a thought. Greatly appreciate all you do!"
