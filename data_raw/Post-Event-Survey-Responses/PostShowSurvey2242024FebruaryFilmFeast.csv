Wine pours and very disappointing so much plastic waste on all the small bites. Felt wrong.  Tiny space even for a partially subscribed event. More people- as you should get- would have made this unbearable   No place to sit for two hours. No place to set a wine glass or plate. No free water. Great inaugural event. Will come back but consider the space limitations as it was a challenge. Also wish additional farmer/food producers were there. My comments are to help. Really so happy we went. Felt like a terrific adventure ",

The ""Feast"" dynamic of the event was really not. I felt people thought of it as a dinner (5pm start?) and ate like they were eating for that. We did arrive 30 min after  5pm and there were no lamb meatballs, and things listed on the sheet. We were crammed in the corner of the room and stood holding a few bites before we had to fight our way to the food again.  Could you do a set up outside if you did the event later in the year, with tables? Could you offer tables downstairs? Could you do a ""feast"" of setting up table to seat 50 or so on the stage, bites served and cleared, dessert served upstairs in Electric Lounge and reset the theater for the shorts? $55 was pricey for the food we got."
