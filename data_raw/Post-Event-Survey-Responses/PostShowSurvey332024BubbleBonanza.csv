I felt a little claustrophobic. The rows were so narrow that we had to practically step on the other people to get to our seats. The wire-type barrier in the front row of the balcony did not feel safe. I also can’t figure out how we would have all gotten out safely if there was a fire. I would rather pay more and have more room to move about. ,My four year old grandson just loved the bubble show. I wish the theater would offer more than one showing (maybe 2:00 and 4:30) so more of his friends could have watched to show too.

I thought the presentation, sound and especially the stage design pretty mediocre.  I think Jeff could benefit from stepping up the design elements a bit.  I appreciated reasonably-priced concessions, because of course the kids wanted popcorn!  Overall I appreciate having alternative kid-friendly programs and activities.  ",
