The sound, staging and lobby setup were very professional and made the experience enjoyable.","The one element I would recommend is to turn the lights over the audience off.  If that is not possible because of safety regulations, at least they could be dimmed down to a level comfortable to be able to focus on the stage."

That's an arduous task considering the intensity of the subject matter.  This is a good way to open lines of communication and fulfill the need to educate people regarding the lack of equity for the black community.","Would have appreciated the house lights not shining directly at me throughout the event.  Made it difficult to watch the performer on stage as the glare was a bit overwhelming.  I had to keep my head down for a good portion of the play.  Despite that, it was good experience.  Many thanks to the Director, Nancy Simon, for bringing this to the Powerhouse."
