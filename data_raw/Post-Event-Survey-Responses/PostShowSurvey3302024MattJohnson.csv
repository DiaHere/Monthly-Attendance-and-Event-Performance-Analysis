Matt Johnson’s sense of humor and spontaneity with the audience and participants he brought up on stage was beyond our expectations!  I was also impressed with how caring and sincere the theater’s volunteers were. My husband and I will definitely be going to more of your shows. We live in Pasco and are in our mid-eighties but it was well worth the drive!  Thank you for being an important part of Walla Walla’s community and culture!  ,Maybe you could list a few of your local hotels near the theater and list phone numbers for people like us that have to travel a ways. Next time we would like to stay at a hotel after the show and not have to drive home so late. It was a beautiful evening out!!!  Thank you!!!

The staff was friendly and helpful, the venue was cozy and offers a wonderful close-up perspective, and the show was entertaining! Lighting was just fine, the sound could have been just a bit louder, sometimes it was hard to hear the audio or Matt talking, but otherwise it was perfect! The value/price is at the top of what we would pay, so at this price range we can thankfully still attend these great shows (just don't inflate the price more :) Thank you GESA Power House Theatre!

The theater has a nice ambience and I am looking forward to returning. My husband and I looked at some of the upcoming events. I was planning on bringing some coworkers to the women’s comedy night but researched the comedians and learned that one uses a lot of profanity. Even when a comedian is funny and entertaining, using profanity, cheapens the show and is not enjoyable, or uplifting. I am very disappointed to find this kind of entertainment being offered at your venue.",

FANTASTIC!!  I would love to see him again.

",Keep including performers which are out of the ordinary.  Never expected to ever see a Magician/Escape Artist in my lifetime.  Was truly enjoyable!!

Good production quality, except for one card trick for which the lighting was dimmed and I couldn’t see a thing he was doing. Thought the tickets were a bit overpriced; $40 seems more reasonable. 
Just as a side note, when I originally saw the photo of him that is included in the brochure and read the description of him as a daring escape artist, I was not interested. I thought the show would be focused on escapes, which I really don’t enjoy (also, I thought the photo gave kind of a dark impression of both him and the show—not appealing to me). I bought the tickets later not realizing this was the same show I’d read about earlier, and regretted it. But we went anyway, so as not to waste the money spent, and happily it was more focused on other kinds of magic than on escapes, so we enjoyed it. However, I don’t think we’d be interested in seeing another magic show in the next year at least.",
