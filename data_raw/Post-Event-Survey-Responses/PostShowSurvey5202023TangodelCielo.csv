The production was excellent from start to finish.  Also, the chance to meet the members of the production after the show added to the enjoyment of the evening.  They are to be complimented for giving their time and interest in our community.  In conversation, it appeared that they did not know the history of the Power House Theatre and were notably impressed when mentioned.  This should be a given when prospective events and performers are being solicited to perform at the Theatre.  Indeed, our evening was special and well worth the price of admission.","Would like to see the pre-show lobby amenities supported to a larger extent.  Would hope it could inspire 'meet and greet', good conversation and the opportunity to meet folks from the community.  Would like to suggest that the refreshments offered, particularly the wines, be priced more reasonably and/or a standard pour of 6 ounces be offered (not 5 oz.).  If the refreshments were more reasonably priced and also advertised with an event, this might help to encourage folks to come a little early and enjoy."

The performers were all certainly competent, even talented, but somehow the production lacked electricity. I believe they would be well served by engaging a theatre director, someone who could give coherence and direction to lighting, costumes, projections and sound. For instance, why were there numerous costume changes for the players, while the female dancer wore a skirt thrown over a studio leotard? Why not a tango dress? What they have almost makes it, and they could go the extra step, but they need fresh eyes to look at it.",Staff at PHT were great as always.
