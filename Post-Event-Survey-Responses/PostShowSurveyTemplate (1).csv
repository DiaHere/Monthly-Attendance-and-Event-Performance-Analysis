I suggest a study be conducted of the number of Gender population attending the events.  Do you have more women or men attending events. Then have your capital improvements to meet those attendance demands for bathroom usage.
I suggest that the Men's bathroom be remodeled given the small square footage.
I suggest the installation of a bath tub urinal to increase usage and still maintain the square footage. Like Baseball stadiums.
The Lobby area was crowded during the intermission. 
THE LOBBY BAR
The Bar area created unusual lines in the crowd to meet the attendees thirst and should be accommodating, relocated and redesigned. 
IMMEDIATE SOLUTION
I suggest a water/soda vending machine be installed reducing the Bar visitation to just Alcohol. 
When buying a ticket, add the cost of two/ water sodas GESA tokens. The GESA token to be handed out at the entry checkpoint. . The GESA tokens would be reused when the machine collection occurs. Cost would be minimal, usage would increase and Bar area crowd reduced.",,

No plot development, no character/relationship development, repetitive flat dialogue, repetitive photography. It was a first-time movie-makers effort and should have been advertised as such. Mis advertising an event doesn’t serve the powerhouse well— people decide they can’t trust the programming and won’t return.

Do you have a local group/ person (marketing person) pre-screening before accepting an item in your programm8mg? That might be safer. This is not censorship.

The sound was fine because we didn't need the mics to hear everything, couldn't really tell you whether the lighting was good or not, we couldn't see. The value was not there. I have back and balance issues so sitting on folding chairs when I expected a ""theatre"" type chair was unacceptable. I should have been warned where the seats were and what I would be sitting on before I purchased my tickets. Also, why didn't your ushers have a diagram of the theatre to help people find their seats, we were told THREE or FOUR times where to sit before we found our folding chairs.","Gerald Friesen, 509-540-1464. The lady we finally had that helped us find our seats was great, she offered to let me get up and walk around during the show and she knew exactly where our seats were, she did have a name tag on that looked like she was someone important. If more of your workers were like her there would be less people people  like me that had to stand and wait while an usher went and got instructions.....that turned out to be WRONG. I had to use the rest room  twice because it took so long to find my folding chair. At least buy 12 to 18 folding chairs that are comfortable to sit on and give these things to someone who deals in SCRAP metal.",Celtic Christmas,12/6/2024

The film sound was muffled in the balcony for us. Also given the accents of the people featured in the films, having captions displayed would have been very helpful. Also good for people with less than perfect hearing. The films felt longer than they needed to be and the subject matter could have more varied. The non-documentary film was entertaining.
