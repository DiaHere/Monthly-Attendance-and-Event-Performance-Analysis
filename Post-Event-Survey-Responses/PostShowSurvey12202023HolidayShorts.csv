The Holiday Shorts I give a C- . Content for the majority of the “shorts” was not what I was expecting (violence, language). A few were “ okay”.  Will not attend again. ","No response necessary. I have attended so many wonderful events at GPHT and will return for many more, but not Holiday Shorts. "

And some were great, so I guess it's the film maker's issue.          The gory film (3 houses down) was awful, a shocking surprise and not the uplifting sort of thing we want from films, especially this time of year. I had to literally cover my eyes and try to not hear what was going on. ",Thank you for continuing to show films!

I resorted to using my hearing aids which helped but did not completely compensate.  I enjoyed the program very much and my wife said she was not much impressed.  (Our reactions to Spanish Shorts were similar.),

It was so random to have a horror film in the middle of the rest of the films which were mostly light hearted. There was no way any patrons would have known that this type of film could be shown as the description of the show didn't really specify what could be shown. Luckily it didn't look like anyone brought their children to the show from what I saw.",

However, with the short film ""Three Doors Down"", the horror about a murderous elf, that film should have been last and a warning about viewer discretion should have been advised. A lot of people left during this film and I think a warning would have been appropriate as all the rest of the films were so lighthearted in comparison. Giving the viewer time to get out of the theater before being subjected to watching... whatever I had watched, would have been appropriate. That film also should have been the last to show, so that viewers were not missing out on other short films if they were to leave.",

I am not hard of hearing.","Please post more information about the content of such collections; that would’ve tipped me off that this wasn’t the kind of show we wanted to see. My mother and I were expecting light-hearted, cheerful, heartwarming holiday fare—as per the title—and found it to be anything but that. Did anyone view it before deciding to show it at GESA? I’m not offended by moderate profanity in most settings (ok, the last clip was kinda funny), but for a *Christmas* collection this was an awful choice. It was dark, profane, disturbing and utterly unsuitable. One clip could only be called a horror short, I don’t care that they tried to be humorous with spurting green blood instead of red. The family in front of us, with three older teenagers, got up and left about ten minutes in. We rode it out hoping it would get better, and afterwards my mild, uncomplaining 83 yo mother simply said, “Well I hope you didn’t pay too much for that.”"
