As far as value, I wish more people had attended since the subject matter is important and one could say universal.  The younger generation in particular needs to be taught about what goes on in foreign countries--e.g., hard to believe some are completely unaware of the holocaust.",Please continue to get the word out.  I think you've done a superlative job in advertising the Gesa Powerhouse and upcoming events.   Thank you to all the volunteers!

There are many good shorts but these were not.  Th taped introduction was worse than none.  Taped interview was dull, poorly done, went on too long (many left in the middle of it).  An in person interview would have been more informative I suspect and at least would have seen how bored the audience was and picked up their game or stopped.  ","Rather than taping Warren, have Warren here to present the movies and give some context responding to audience.  If he can’t come, have another person stand before audience and read his introduction and try to answer questions.  Skip amateurish taped interviews.  Sorry for this poor review.  It was a disappointing night.  "
