The value of ticket price to performance was startling, as the cost seemed low for the very high quality of performance (not a complaint at all, and our tickets were actually paid from a gift certificate). We left feeling upbeat and totally satisfied, not only with the performance but with the theatre experience. The people who work the events are always great!",

The only thing that bothered us was the couple seated in front of us, we had G-9 and G- 10 seats. At intermission, the man, I certainly wouldn’t call him a gentleman, came us to us. I had complimented his female friend about her attire. He then said , my friend and I were too “chatty “ and could we not whisper or comment on the performance as it was distracting for him. We sat through the rest of the show in silence, while the audience continued to enjoy the wonderful display of talent we had mutually payed for. We were not by any means, outspoken or overbearing with making soft comments about  the amazing performance we were witnessing. I thank everyone that gives Walla Walla these amazing performances.","Excellent staff, volunteers."

The sound was clear and at an appropriate volume making it a pleasant experience and bringing out the characteristics of each instrument:  marimba (xylophone), standard flute, Native American flute (one of my favorites; so haunting), saxophone(s), piano, standard (stick) drumming, long djembe(?) hand drumming along with extras like juggling, tap dancing, beat boxing and singing.  Very well done!","The members of Collision of Rhythm were two extremely talented guys whose desire is clearly to teach and create a community-based experience.  Their enthusiasm shined on us all, and the audience participation was absolutely essential to a successful performance.  ""We...we are made of music!""  To have a venue of inclusivity for younger and older generations alike is welcome.  The fast-moving tempo of the show kept it captivating.  Would love to see them return to the Gesa Powerhouse Theatre.  More power!"
