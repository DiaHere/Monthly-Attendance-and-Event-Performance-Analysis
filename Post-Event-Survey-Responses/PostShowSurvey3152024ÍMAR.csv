I  found the group engaging and talented.  They had the whole theatre participating in their program.  The sound/light tech was professional and on the mark for the performance.,

Gesa is a small theater , and performers should adjust the volume of their performance . At times it was almost painful. It was also difficult to understand some of the dialogue d/t accents. Understand that is my problem but I did miss much of the discussions and funny stories! We came home and watched the group on  uTube where we could turn the volume down!",

We sat in the balcony and a couple thoughts to improve that experience would be to have the band, etc set back a little bit on the stage so there is better viewing from the balcony.  The second suggestion is to get rid of the first row, would make better for flow of traffic and visibility in the balcony.

We absolutely loved Imar and so grateful you brought them to this area.  We would love to attend more events with this style.",I would also suggest providing posters in the Pendleton area for your events.  I just happened to see a poster while visiting in Starbucks in Walla Walla.  We are happy to travel from Pendleton for this quality of an event.
