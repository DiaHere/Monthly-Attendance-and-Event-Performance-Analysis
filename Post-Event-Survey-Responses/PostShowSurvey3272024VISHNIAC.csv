Sound quality was a little muddy and the screen seemed to be be a bit wavy, but not too bad.  And better to see this at your theater than on my computer or home TV.","I understand your preference for selling tickets in advance, but perhaps allow an option of not selecting seats? In this case the small-ish crowd ended up bunched together due to that requirement, and I was initially seated behind a really tall person. Luckily we were able to move down a few seats so I could see.
Also it looks like you are bringing more films to Gesa--great! I hope you'll send out emails about these."

Lighting and sound were very acceptable.,"One had to pay strict attention to what was enveloping on the screen.  Based on the rate at which the photos played through, it was quite literally like fast film.  What a treasure of a story and collection of memories.  Extremely touching that one would unwrap themselves and their family's true history before an audience.  A good educational experience."
