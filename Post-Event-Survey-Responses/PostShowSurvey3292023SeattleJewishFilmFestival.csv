I liked the 3 separate sections of similar films. I was sorry more people didn't attend.,"The ushers should be more aware of their voices carrying when they're having conversations during films.      

Thank you for hosting the film festival again!"

Thank you!!","At the very beginning, there was quite  a bit of writing on the screen, I think an overview of the theme of the films, and I'm a fast reader but I couldn't get through it all before it was gone!!  Please leave things up long enough for everyone to read. 

In the interviews at the end, the first one was great, it followed the filmmaker's film. But the second one I couldn't tell at all what film she had made, and it was getting boring since there was no connection, and several of us just left. 

But truly, overall, I loved this group of films!!"

With this intimate venue, the quality of the lighting and sound (good volume) was appropriate.  Even with a small number of attendees, the value of such films does not lose its importance.  After all, just one person can start a ripple.  Well done.  Keep it up!","Despite being Yiddish-impaired, my brain was connecting synapses at random and inter-communicating in an uncommon way.  The richness of the films allowed me to experience different levels of thought almost like a set of never-ending, falling dominoes.  The interviews (e.g., Sean Wainstein/Demon Box) shed new light on what the films delivered.  It became more than the sum of dark and light or the holocaust and survivorship--developing into an all-encompassing life and love of mankind thereafter.  That we’re all present in this “middle” of our lives because we’re not at the hour of our birth and not yet dead, was very powerful and thought-provoking."

The two best films were the two that had director interviews at the end.   Sound was good, lighting was good .   Sorry it was a low turn out.   I am proud that you brought these films to a place with a very small Jewish population. I’d also like to see films from the Muslim world, and other parts of the world and its people.","Please no depressed/ psychotic stories . We want to learn, be enlightened, and engaged in a positive way."
