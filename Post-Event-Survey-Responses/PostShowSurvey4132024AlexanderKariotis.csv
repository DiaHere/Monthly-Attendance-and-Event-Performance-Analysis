When there are going to be flashing lights in a performance,  you need to warn the audience. You are lucky no one had an epileptic seizure. 
He had a very powerful voice that did not need amplification but he did use the microphone. The sound system needed to be modulated to take that into account as it was too loud.",Installing a drinking fountain would be wonderful and much appreciated.  I do not want to buy a plastic bottle of water. Either that or let me bring my own bottle of water.

It was too bad the slideshow wasn’t working because that would’ve added some visual interest for sure. Overall the concert seemed like glorified karaoke. It was a surprise to not have any other musicians with him. It was on the edge of being too loud a lot of the time, as has been the case for other concerts. We left at intermission. ",

 directly in front of him.  He didn't need the video screen behind him.  Could concentrate on his performance better.  Too bad WW Symphony couldn't play with him.  I never knew one could combine Rock and Opera.  I'm a fan.",I think we are so fortunate he came to WW.  I hope he comes back some day.  I loved it.

He was awful; did not hit all his notes, lip synced some songs, pretended to play his guitar when it was a recording.  It was the worst $90 I have spent.",
