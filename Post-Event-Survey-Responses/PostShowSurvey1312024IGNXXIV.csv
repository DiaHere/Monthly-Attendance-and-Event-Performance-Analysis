My husband and I are big fans of Luca and Thu Le and were super excited to see that they would be performing in Walla Walla. We were thrilled with the value, performance, and lighting. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. There were a couple of mishaps with the sound, but they were handled well and didn't detract from the show at all. Overall, we were incredibly impressed and are looking forward to visiting again in the future, especially if International Guitar Night returns. No other suggestions except to thank everyone who worked hard to put on an incredible evening. From the ushers, the box office staff, the refreshment staff, greeters, sound and lighting, stage managers, and all of the other traditionally unseen jobs: you are phenomenal and should be proud of putting on one of the best events I've ever been to! Thank you for a wonderful and memorable night.",

I will watch for this event again for sure. ,"I was seated in the front row of the balcony, a great seat for the show.  However, walking past me to the center aisle seemed to be the only way others could access their seats.   The walkway is quite narrow also.   So I either had to keep getting up and down MANY times or keep bumping and annoying people as they tried to squeeze past.    Additional access routes to the seats in the middle would be good idea, perhaps an aisle across the top to the stairways, where the prospect of falling over the barrier to the loge below would not be an issue?"

Sound made the chairs vibrate which was sometimes uncomfortable.,I wish there was more legroom.  I also think there should either be a drinking fountain or we should be allowed to bring our own water. I do not want to keep buying bottle water.

A couple of times, sound-surging feedback got pretty loud; fortunately, it was short-lived.  Then, there was a glimmering or bright glare strobing off one of the guitars due to the lighting angle.  It was projected into the crowd, and some of us couldn't look at the stage as a result.  Again, it didn't last long and was tolerable.  The majority of the show was fantastic.  The collaborative and individual guitar playing ranged from mesmerizing to rock wake up!","The guitarists were so generous with their collaborations.  Not only did they spotlight each other, but they engaged in well-meaning competition which magnified their own talents as well.  The concept of combining musical artists from different countries is an extraordinary way to learn about the sounds of other cultures.  Combining players from Vietnam, Italy, Brazil and Australia turned out a remarkable, eclectic, harmonic and savory blending of genres.  VIBA (the first letter of each country) Las Vegas, baby!
