Her discomfort with social interactions was understandable to me because I also have been uncomfortable in groups.",

Quality films like this will entice me to return for more.  Sound was clear.  Lighting was good. Was delighted to see Warren Etheredge made the trip over from Seattle to be at the screening in person.  That certainly indicates how important this film is.  Thanks to him!,"Wasn't sure what to expect based on the title.  The pre-film video clip gave me some helpful insight that it might not be entirely depressing.  Was initially thinking it may focus on suicide; then again, it could just be a coming of ""old"" age story and facing death.  The unravelling of the story kept me intrigued, and the primary relationship was brutally honest.  Found it quirky and sincere.  People seemed familiar with Daisy Ridley.  Haven't seen all the Star Wars films that brought her fame.  Glad local actor, Rich Hintz, was featured."

Seats at good angle. ,All the good parts were shown in the trailer. This show was slow and awkward. At the end I just wanted to use the restroom and go home so the post show Q&A was not my favorite.
