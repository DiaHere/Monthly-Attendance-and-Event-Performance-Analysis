Hope they both return to the Powerhouse.  The event was well-timed with Black History month, so thematic shows might be well-received.","Always enjoy the array of entertainers from musicians to comedians.  Would like to see more rock 'n roll bands--even if of the ""tribute"" kind.  The ones that were brought to the Powerhouse have been pretty exceptional.  They've also been repeat performances that sell fairly well.  So a few more of those could be the bread and butter of entertainment.at Gesa.  Would also welcome more jazz and blues bands and perhaps some modern dance routines.  Also like the rhythm and sounds of bongo drums, calypso or steel drums."
