My only feedback is that the railing right in front of the BB seating was very low and I assume it is for viewing purposes but it was scary walking by that especially for someone scared of heights and also not great with balance. Otherwise it was a great evening.  Thank you! "

He was pretty funny and knows how to get the audience involved.  I would recommend him to others and hope he returns some day soon with a new slate of comedic originals.  Thanks for giving him a stage to stand on and to send us into 2024 on a positive note.,"As the Powerhouse Theater becomes more popular and makes enough money for improvements, please consider making changes to the facility.  I think it could be a better venue over time if more funds would be spent to enhance the interior, but not take away from the historic nature of the building.  Thanks."

Sound and lighting were great, the comic was very enjoyable, and the tickets were reasonably priced. I thought the champagne toast was a very nice thought, but wasn't executed very well. ","This was our first time to the theater, and we really enjoyed the event! I realize that there may be very little that can be done about this, but my main comment for things to improve would be the congestion of the lobby before the show. I realize there are several things that need to take place (will call, ticket scanning, coat check, bar, etc.) in a relatively small space, but the crowding means people have to wait outside for a while so that they can squeeze between people to get through the lobby. Perhaps longer hours for the bar, moving will call, or something like that would be helpful for reducing congestion. That said, the staff were all very friendly, welcoming, and helpful!"

Also, consistency in pricing on the website from the main page throughout the event pages...Many times it differs and is conflicting...ticket pricing info should be clear and concise at a minimum, especially at the prices being charged. These aren't discount/cheap tickets. Another little detail--When popcorn is served in the lobby - Make it fresh...Nothing says ""We got you good"" like paying $4 for a tiny bag of popcorn...only to find out it is STALE. That's just bad business and acting in bad faith"

We look foreword to next years New Years eve show, we have been at most of the New Years shows since the theatre started, they've all been enjoyable. 
  Thank You very much. Darrin and Lori.",
