I wish there had been more marketing on their music to the WW, M-F & Tri-Cities region.  I think you would have been completely sold out.  There would have been more of Hispanic turn out even if it was on a Thursday.  I would most definitely go again if they come back to WW.  Thank you so much for bringing them to WW Gesa Power House Theatre...  & for all you do for our WW Region in the ARTS. "
