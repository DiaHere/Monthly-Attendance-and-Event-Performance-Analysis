The lighting was perfect.  I loved the fact that WW has such a great venue at very affordable ticket prices.  The seating arrangement was laid out perfect.  The balcony looked like it had a great view of the stage.  The seating did seem to be a little tight.  I felt a little confined, but otherwise I had a great time.  Nice job Gesa Power House!",I know this is a stretch but seating is a little cramped.  I know this would be very costly to change.  It was just a thought.  It won't deter me from coming to future events.
