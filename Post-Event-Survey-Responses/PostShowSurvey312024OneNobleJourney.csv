I went because my granddaughter s@w him through his school performance. Next year it would be a new group of kids. And more families might come. Give family discounts. A great way to teach history.

Regardless of the small audience size, he entertained, engaged, and performed with the greatest interests. Sound was an issue for both the announcer and actor as was conversation during the performance. It sounded like one of the entry doors was left open and what was meant to be a private conversation was now public. A friend had heard about his performance from a grade school grandchild who was impressed with his message and performance. The children, whom he selected to interact on stage were delighted to be chosen. His Q & A after was engaging and encouraged those free thinking artisans in the audience to continue to see this gift as valuable, as he relayed his interest in people watching and mimicing voices/body language as a child, which led to his performance career.  We are glad to hear that he will be returning next year.","Perhaps complimentary tickets at the school performances, which would be coordinated through school office personnel would be another incentive for families to attend."

It was high-quality, lighting and sound was good - I didn't even know that the mic was off - the sound in the theater is great.  The House did a great job.  I look forward to his return for another production.","This is the time that I went to the bathroom after the performance and when I got to the lobby it was just a few people left.  I don't know what can be done to keep people to chat afterwards.  Perhaps it was such an uncomfortable topic that some felt they needed to go to their comfort zone.
LOVED the evening!"
